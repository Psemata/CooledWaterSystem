# CooledWaterSystem

## Introduction
As part of the 3rd-year Artificial Intelligence module in Software and Multimedia Development at HE-Arc, a practical exercise on "Machine Learning" is required. In this practical work, a specific dataset is provided to each group. Our group has chosen a dataset representing data from a water cooling system.

The goal of the implemented models is to predict the temperature after the water passes through the cooling fan section.

## Documentation
This Git repository contains various Markdown files that serve as documentation for the multiple models implemented in this project.

### Neural Network
The explanation of the neural network model can be found in the file "NeuralNetwork.md."

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)
The explanation of the SVR model can be found in the file "SVR.md."

### Decision Tree
The explanation of the decision tree model can be found in the file "DT.md."

## Conclusion
After creating and testing the three different models listed above, it can be seen that the performances are quite similar. However, since this is a learning scenario, it is normal for simple models to achieve interesting results.
As discussed in class, each model has its strengths and weaknesses, so it is important for developers to use the right model at the right time.
